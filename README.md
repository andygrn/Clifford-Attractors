# Clifford Attractors

Using canvas to generate interesting 2D blobs. Got the idea and formulae from [Clifford Attractors](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/clifford/).

## Options

**a**, **b**, **c** and **d** are numbers that plug into the formulae. Just play around! The web console in Chrome or Firebug prints the actual values if you need them.

**Scale** makes the shape bigger or smaller.

**Opacity** is self explanatory.
